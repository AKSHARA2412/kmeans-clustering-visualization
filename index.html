            <b>Summary:</b> K-means is an unsupervised clustering algorithm that groups similar data points without requiring labeled data. It uses Euclidean distance to determine similarity between points. The algorithm begins by selecting random centroids, assigns data points to the nearest centroid, updates centroids to the average of assigned points, and repeats until convergence. It minimizes inertia, which measures total within-cluster variance. K-means performs best with round clusters of similar spread and may struggle with irregular shapes or outliers. Proper preprocessing and selecting an appropriate number of clusters improve results.

            <li><b>Domain Description:</b> This project focuses on unsupervised machine learning, specifically clustering using the K-Means algorithm. It groups data points based on feature similarity while minimizing internal variance.</li>

            <li><b>Data Description:</b> The dataset contains 100 observations representing cat features such as chonkiness and fur lightness. Data points are clustered based on similarity to form distinct groups.</li>

            <li><b>Visualization Reflection:</b> The visualization allows users to select different datasets dynamically. Scatter plots update interactively to show data points, clusters, centroids, and decision boundaries. Draggable prototypes and real-time updates enhance learning and engagement.</li>

            <li><b>Narrative Structure:</b> The scrollytelling format integrates textual explanations with interactive visuals. It guides users from problem introduction to algorithm behavior and cluster properties, creating a structured and educational experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <b>Reflection:</b> This project highlights how K-Means simplifies complex datasets by identifying meaningful groupings. It demonstrates the importance of choosing appropriate cluster counts, preprocessing data, and understanding algorithm limitations when working with different data distributions.
