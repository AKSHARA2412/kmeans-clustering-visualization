# Homework #1: Scrollytelling in the Wild

The purpose of this assignment is to get you thinking about visualization and storytelling from a design persepective and to give you a bit of practice and exposure to making a web page (programming in HTML and CSS). You should find a scrollytelling story online somewhere that you think is interesting. The story should combine scrollytelling with data visualizations and text narratives to create an attractive, insightful, moving, or interesting data-driven story.

Once you've found the scrollytelling story you want to use, do the following by modifying the `index.html` page. Once you're done, commit/push the updated page back to this repository to submit your assignment.

- First, take a screenshot of the webpage showing (part of) the story and put it in the `imgs/` folder. In the `index.html` page, replace the `sparky.jpg` image with your screenshot.
- At the top of the page, add your name and email in the appropriate place.
- Below your scrollytelling picture, put a title for the story (it's fine to use the title of the page you took it from) and update the "Link to story" URL to direct to the page where you found the visualization.

Next, replace the Lorem Ipsum text on the page accordingly:

- **Summary**: Provide a brief, high-level description of the story. What is the "plot" of the story, and what is the intended takeaway or "conclusion"? (~1 paragraph)
- **Domain Description**: Who are the likely intended readers for this story? (1-2 sentences)
- **Data Descrption**: What type of data or datasets are being shown here? Briefly describe it. (1-2 sentences)
- **Visualization Reflection**: How are the visualizations used in the story? You might think about things like: How do they help advance the plot? Are the visualizations connected or linekd together - is this good or bad? Do they contain interactivity? What types of techniques are used, and why did thet designer choose them? (~1 paragraph)
- **Reflection on Other Narrative Cues and Structuring:** In addition to the visualizations themselves, what other types of narrative elements, cues, design strategies, use of scrollytelling triggers, etc. are used to create, organize, and present the story? (~1 paragraph)
- **Personal Thoughts**: Do you think this is a good and/or interesting story? Why or why not? (~1 paragraph)
