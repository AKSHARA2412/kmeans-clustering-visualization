Project Title: K-Means Clustering Visualization (Scrollytelling Review)

Project Overview:

This project analyzes and documents a scrollytelling-based visualization that explains the K-Means clustering algorithm.

The story demonstrates how data points are grouped, how centroids are updated, and how cluster boundaries evolve over iterations.

The goal is to communicate key clustering concepts in an interactive and visually engaging manner.

Target Audience:

Students learning unsupervised machine learning.

Individuals exploring clustering algorithms for the first time.

Readers interested in interactive data storytelling.

Data Description:

The visualization uses a simplified dataset containing feature pairs (e.g., attributes such as chonkiness and fur lightness).

The dataset is structured to clearly demonstrate clustering behavior and algorithm mechanics.

The focus is on illustrating algorithm behavior rather than analyzing large-scale real-world data.

Visualization Design and Techniques:

Interactive scatter plots represent data points and cluster assignments.

Centroids and decision boundaries update dynamically.

Users can interact with the visualization to observe how initialization affects final clusters.

Color and positioning are used to encode cluster membership and similarity.

Narrative Structure and Storytelling Approach:

The scrollytelling format integrates explanatory text with visual transitions.

Each step introduces a concept and visually demonstrates its effect.

The layout guides users progressively from basic clustering intuition to algorithm limitations.

Key Insights and Reflections:

K-Means is sensitive to centroid initialization.

The algorithm performs best with roughly spherical clusters.

Preprocessing and proper scaling significantly impact results.

Interactive storytelling enhances conceptual understanding compared to static visuals.
